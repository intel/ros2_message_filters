# ROS2 Message Filters 

`ros2_message_filters` blends various messages based on the conditions that filter needs to met and derives from ROS2 porting of [ROS message_filters](http://wiki.ros.org/message_filters). It collects commonly used message "filtering" algorithms into a common space. A message filter is defined as something which a message arrives into and may or may not be spit back out of at a later point in time. 


**The API is a combination of parts:**
- Filter Pattern
  - `registerCallback(cb)`
  - `connectInput(filter)`
- Subscriber
  - `subscribe(nodep, topic, 1, myCallback)`
- Time Synchronizer
  - Input : 
    - C++: Up to 9 separate filters, each of which is of the form `void callback(const std::shared_ptr<M const>&)`. The number of filters supported is determined by the number of template arguments the class was created with. 
    - Python: N separate filters, each of which has signature `callback(msg)`. 
  - Output : 
    - C++: For message types M0..M8, `void callback(const std::shared_ptr<M0 const>&`, ..., `const std::shared_ptr<M8 const>&)`. The number of parameters is determined by the number of template arguments the class was created with.
    - Python: `callback(msg0.. msgN)`. The number of parameters is determined by the number of template arguments the class was created with.

```
  #include <message_filters/subscriber.h>
  #include <message_filters/time_synchronizer.h>
  #include <sensor_msgs/Image.h>
  #include <sensor_msgs/CameraInfo.h>

  using namespace sensor_msgs;
  using namespace message_filters;
    
  void callback(const ImageConstPtr& image, const CameraInfoConstPtr& cam_info)
  {
     // Solve all of perception here...
  }
  
  int main(int argc, char** argv)
  {
    rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
    auto nh = std::make_shared<rclcpp::Node>("test_node");
    Subscriber<Image> image_sub(nh.get(), "image");
    Subscriber<CameraInfo> info_sub(nh.get(), "camera");
    TimeSynchronizer<Image, CameraInfo> sync(image_sub, info_sub, 10);
    sync.registerCallback(std::bind(&callback, _1, _2));
    rclcpp::spin(nh);
    return 0;
   }
```

**Environment**

* Hardware: Compliant to ROS2 HW requirements
* Software: ROS2 + Supported OS(Linux, Win, Mac)

**How to build and test ROS2 message filters**
- Clone and build ROS2 source code under ros2 workspace, please refer to [ROS2 Installation](http://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki/Installation) for more details and the following is the example in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
```
$cd ~/<ros2_workspace>
$src/ament/ament_tools/scripts/ament.py build --build-tests --symlink-install
```
- Build message filters
```
$cd src/ros2
$git clone https://github.com/intel/ros2_message_filters.git
$source <ros2_workspace>/install/local_setup.bash
$ament build src/ros2/ros2_message_filters
```
- Run unit tests
```
$ament test src/ros2/ros2_message_filters
